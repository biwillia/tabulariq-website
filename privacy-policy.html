If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be collected within the United States.

            <h3> Information that BWITSS Collects </h3>
            <p> BWITSS collects the following information: </p>
            <p>a) Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your real name, address, phone number, or e-mail address).  Providing personally identifiable information is voluntary.  You may, however, not be able to use the full functionality of this website if you do not provide certain information.  BWITSS collects personally identifiable information that you provide during your use of the website, including: </p>
               <ul class="custom-list1">
               <li> <span> . </span> information for using our online store or otherwise managing a BWITSS user account, including your name and contact information.  We use credit card information only to pass on to our credit card processors and do not store the credit card number after the purchase is complete.  However, for historic receipt purposes, we do store the card type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.), the last three digits of the card (e.g., xxxx xxxx xxxx x123) and expiration date.  These appear on your receipt page; </li>
                <li> <span> . </span> information you provide when you sign up for community aspects of our website (forums, wiki, etc.).  As a guideline, but without limitation, our forum registration collects a name, and a valid email address and other optional information; </li>
                 <li> <span> . </span> information you provide when you sign up for any services (e.g., newsletter or marketing offers) offered on the website; and </li>
                  <li> <span> . </span>  information collected when you contact us via online forms (providing feedback, sales questions, etc.) or offline methods (e.g., telephone). </li>
            </ul>

            <p> BWITSS Website Cookies:  We use cookies, but only to store session information (like a store purchase), for keeping your login/password information live (if you so choose) for community aspects of the site (forums, wiki, etc.), to limit multiple responses and registrations, or to track usage patterns on the website or to analyze user activity on the site (without tying that information to personally identifiable information, except that your submissions and postings in the user forums and wiki portions of the website will be stored and available to BWITSS and other users and include your on-screen identification).  Cookies are text files used to identify users and possibly to prepare customized web pages for the user.  You may configure your browser to reject cookies but, if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.</p>
            <p> Web Server Log Information:  BWITSS collects non-personally identifiable web log information regarding visitors to its website and each visitor's activity on the website.  This information includes, but is not limited to your IP address, the time and date of your visit(s), the pages you visit, the frequency of your visits and the length of stay on each page, your browser type, and information that identifies any linking or referral web page visited prior and /or subsequent to visiting our website. </p>
            <p> Javascript:  BWITSS uses third party web log analysis services (e.g., Google Analytics) for web log analysis and, therefore, non-personally identifiable web log information is transferred to these third parties and stored by them on their servers.  These services require the use of Javascript code in our web pages in order to transfer the web log information.  We then use this information to track how users interact with, and reach our website.  BWITSS's analytics vendors may also transfer this information to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on behalf of BWITSS's vendors.  By using this website, you consent to the processing of data by these services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. </p>
            <p> The BWITSS website is not directed at children and BWITSS does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13) years of age unless the collection complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").  If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, do not send any information about yourself to BWITSS.  If BWITSS discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided BWITSS with personally identifiable information, BWITSS will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that child's personally identifiable information from its system. </p> 
            <p> You may have the opportunity to provide us with the personally identifiable information of a friend (or a friend of yours may provide BWITSS personally identifiable information about you), such as if you chose to email a friend a link, notice or other special feature from BWITSS's website.  Any email address that you supply to BWITSS for those activities will not be retained, or used, for other purposes unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time the information is collected.  We encourage you to send items from our websites only to recipients who are your friends or family or persons with whom you have a relationship that would expect such information, so that it does not seem like we are soliciting them. </p>

     <div class="block-element mb-4">
         <div class="legal-textual">
            <h3> How BWITSS Uses your Information </h3>
            <p> We only use personally identifiable information collected from you for the purpose disclosed at the time the information is collected (e.g., we will collect credit card information to process a payment and we will collect contact information to manage your product licenses).  We will only use personally identifiable information to contact you: </p>
            <ul class="custom-list1">
               <li> <span> . </span> to provide you with requested purchases, information, services or content;  </li>
               <li> <span> . </span>  to notify you about BWITSS's new product and services offerings, including software, software releases and services; </li>
               <li> <span> . </span> in reference to your licenses to use BWITSS software; </li>
               <li> <span> . </span> to enforce the Terms of Use of this website and to address any problems or concerns we have regarding your use of this website; or  </li>
               <li> <span> . </span> to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our website. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> We will not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties, except for legal compliance purposes, as described in the "Assignability" section below, or if you give us your consent.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, "legal compliance purposes" includes, without limitation, compliance with laws, cooperation with any governmental investigation and disclosure whenever BWITSS believes disclosure is necessary to limit its legal liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests, or safety of the website, our users or any third party.  If you elect to receive communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.  If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly. </p>
            <p> BWITSS may use non-personally identifiable information for many reasons, such as system administration, marketing analysis, to audit use of our website and to report aggregate information to our business partners.  BWITSS may associate your IP address or other non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information that you provide, but BWITSS will use this aggregated information solely for BWITSS's internal business purposes, subject to this Privacy Policy as it pertains to personally identifiable information.  BWITSS may disclose aggregated non-personally identifiable information to third parties. </p>
            <p> BWITSS may share personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with entities that perform functions on behalf of BWITSS.  For example, and without limitation, BWITSS may share your information with entities that host this website, send communications on our behalf, analyze data, and provide customer service.  These third parties may have access to your information, including personally identifiable information, only to the extent it is necessary to perform their duties and functions, and subject to this Privacy Policy. </p>

            <h3> BWITSS's User Forums and Wiki </h3>
           <p> BWITSS provides user forums and a wiki that allow users to contribute content to the website.  If you submit to BWITSS a comment, code, work of authorship, photograph or any other content to be published by BWITSS (either online or offline), you agree that we may publish your name or other personally identifiable information in connection with publishing the content. </p>
           <p> Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for user forums and the wiki in our Terms of Use.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly in user forums or through the wiki.  You should keep in mind that whenever you post information about yourself in the user forums and wiki, that information could be collected and used by people that you do not know.  In addition, certain user forums may display the message poster's name and message.  BWITSS bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose in user forums or other public areas, if any, of this website. </p>

            <h3> Your Choices Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information  </h3>
            
            <p>  You have the ability at any time to access your BWITSS Account, forum profile or wiki profile and update your name, contact information, email address, and other information that you provide via a login on the BWITSS website.  You can also review your historical purchase information on your BWITSS Account, but you can not change the purchase history information.  You should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. </p>
            <p> Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where: (a) you make a specific request for information from us, or (b) BWITSS uses your personally identifiable information for either operational purposes (e.g. to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website) or fulfillment purposes (e.g. completing any purchase you make). </p>
